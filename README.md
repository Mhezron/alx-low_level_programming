## Introduction

The ALX Low-Level Programming repository is a part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering program. It aims to provide learners with hands-on experience in low-level programming concepts, such as memory management, pointers, data structures, and system-level programming.

## Projects

In this repository, you'll find various projects that cover different aspects of low-level programming. Each project is placed in its respective directory, and they are designed to challenge and improve your coding skills. Here are some of the projects you can find:

1. **0x00-hello_world**: This project covers the basics of C programming, including compiling and executing simple programs.

2. **0x01-variables_if_else_while**: In this project, you'll work with variables, conditional statements, and loops.

3. **0x02-functions_nested_loops**: Here, you'll dive into functions and nested loops.

4. **0x03-debugging**: Learn how to debug C programs effectively.

5. **0x04-more_functions_nested_loops**: More practice with functions and nested loops.

And many more projects await you as you progress through the ALX Low-Level Programming journey!

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need the following:

1. **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. The most commonly used C compiler is GCC. You can install GCC on Linux or use the appropriate C compiler for your operating system.

2. **Git**: You'll need Git to clone this repository onto your local machine.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mhezron/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

### Running the Programs

Each project folder contains various C files that can be compiled separately using GCC. For example, to compile and run a C file in the project `0x00-hello_world`, you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world
gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o hello main.c
./hello
```

Make sure to read the specific instructions and requirements for each project before running the code.
