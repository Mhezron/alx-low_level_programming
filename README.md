## Introduction

This repository is a part of the ALX Software Engineering program, which focuses on providing students with a deep understanding of low-level programming languages such as C and assembly. Low-level programming is essential for gaining insights into how computers operate at a fundamental level, and it is a crucial skill for developing efficient and optimized software.

## Projects

The repository contains various projects that cover different aspects of low-level programming. Each project is located in its own directory and comes with its own set of instructions and requirements. Some of the projects you'll find in this repository include:

- **0x00-hello_world**: An introductory project that covers the basics of C programming, compilation, and debugging.

- **0x01-variables_if_else_while**: This project focuses on variables, conditional statements (if/else), and loops (while) in C.

- **0x02-functions_nested_loops**: Here, you'll work with functions and nested loops to solve specific tasks.

- **0x03-debugging**: Debugging is a critical skill for any programmer. This project is designed to improve your debugging abilities in C.

... and more!

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mhezron/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the directory of the project you want to work on using the `cd` command:

   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world
   ```

3. **Read Instructions**: Each project directory contains its own `README.md` file with instructions and requirements for completing the project. Read this file thoroughly before you begin.

## Usage

Inside each project directory, you'll find C code files, header files, and other necessary resources. You can compile and run the code using a C compiler such as GCC. Follow the instructions provided in the project's `README.md` file to understand how to compile and test your code.

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic my_file.c -o my_program
./my_program
```
